    "# Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that can be used to describe the evolution of observable events depending on internal factors that are not directly observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### States\n",
    "\n",
    "Let \\[ S = \\{S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N\\} \\] be the set of hidden states in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let \\[ O = \\{O_1, O_2, \\ldots, O_T\\} \\] be the sequence of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Transition Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The state transition probabilities are represented by the matrix \\( A \\), where each element \\( a_{ij} \\) is the probability of transitioning from state \\( i \\) to state \\( j \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1N} \\\\\n",
    "a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2N} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "a_{N1} & a_{N2} & \\cdots & a_{NN}\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "### Observation Probability Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation probability distribution in state \\( j \\) is given by \\( B = \\{b_j(o_t)\\} \\), where \\( b_j(o_t) \\) is the probability of observing \\( o_t \\) from state \\( j \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "b_1(O_1) & b_1(O_2) & \\cdots & b_1(O_T) \\\\\n",

    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial State Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial state distribution is represented by \\( \\pi \\), where \\( \\pi_i \\) is the probability that the Markov chain will start in state \\( i \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\pi = (\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\ldots, \\pi_N)\n",

    "## The Three Fundamental Problems for HMMs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Likelihood**: Given the HMM parameters and an observation sequence, determine the likelihood of the sequence.\n",
    "2. **Decoding**: Given the observation sequence and the HMM parameters, determine the most likely sequence of hidden states.\n",
    "3. **Learning**: Adjust the model parameters to maximize the probability of the observation sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Application: Forex Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Forex trading, HMMs can be used to model various market states and the likelihood of transitions between these states based on observable data like price movements.\n",
